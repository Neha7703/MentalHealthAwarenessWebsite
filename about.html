    <section class="about-statistics">
        <div class="statistics">
            <div>Mental health is a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the 
                normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her 
                community. Mental health includes "subjective well-being, perceived self-efficacy, autonomy, competence, intergenerational
                dependence, and self-actualization of one's intellectual and emotional potential, among others. It is all about how people 
                think, feel, and behave. People sometimes use the term “mental health” to mean the absence of a mental disorder.
                Conditions such as stress, depression, and anxiety can all affect one's mental health. We must help promote the mental 
                well-being of individuals and address the needs of those with defined mental disorders.</div>
            <div>Mental health is a major concern worldwide and India is not far behind in sharing this. If we evaluate developments in the field of mental health, the pace appears to be slow. Dr. Brock Chisholm, the first Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), in 1954, had presciently declared that “without mental health there can be no true physical health.” 
                About 14% of the global burden of disease is attributed to neuropsychiatric disorders. The burden of mental disorders is likely to have been underestimated because of inadequate appreciation of the inter-play between mental illness and other health disorders. There remain considerable issues of priority-setting based 
                on the burden of health problems and of addressing inequalities in relation to determinants and solutions for health problems. Progress in mental health service delivery has been slow in most low- and 
                middle-income countries. Barriers include the existing public-health priorities and its influence on funding; challenges to delivery of mental health care in primary-care settings; the low numbers of those trained in mental health care; and the lack of mental health perspective in public-health leadership.[3] There have been numerous calls for invoking political 
                will, for enhancing advocacy and for galvanizing community participation; all with scant improvement in outcomes.
                Thus, it becomes now opportune to explore the paradigm of mental health awareness as a means of combating stigma, enhancing prevention, ensuring early recognition, and also stimulating simple and 
                practical interventions within the community. Today there are opportunities in terms of growing acknowledgement of mental disorders as key targets of global health action, as well as of leveraging new technologies particularly internet, big data and cell phones in amplifying simple field interventions found successful in primary care and other echelons.</div>
            <div>Risk factors for mental health conditions</div>
            <div><ul class="bullet">

                <li>A large proportion of people with a mental health disorder have more than one condition at a time.</li>        
                <li>It is important to note that good mental health depends on a delicate balance of factors and that several elements of life and the world at large can work together to contribute to disorders</div>
