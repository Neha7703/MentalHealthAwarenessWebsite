    <section class="create-awareness-title">
        <div>Mental health awareness campaigns have yielded positive outcomes. Some of the strategies undertaken to target awareness and address stigma around mental illness include participation by family members, sensitization to treatment and social inclusion. Lack of knowledge about the mental illnesses poses a challenge to the mental health care delivery system. Research has highlighted the role of community-based systems in low-income countries and has also yielded positive results in creating awareness, thereby impacting participation. 
            Awareness and health literacy are two sides of the same coin. Stigma and discrimination are negative consequences of ignorance and misinformation. There are a few studies which have measured mental health literacy in the Indian context. One study found mental health literacy among adolescents to be very low, i.e., depression was identified by 29.04% and schizophrenia/psychosis was recognized only by 1.31%. Stigma was noted to be present in help-seeking. 
            These findings reinforce the need to increase awareness of mental health. Mental health literacy is a related concept which is increasingly seen as an important measure of the awareness and knowledge of mental health disorders. Health literacy has been described as “ability to access, understand, and use the information to promote and maintain good health.” Mental health literacy encompasses recognition, causes, self-help, facilitation of professional intervention, and navigating the information highway. Attitudes which hinder recognition and appropriate help-seeking can be counter-acted by information which is already readily available in the public domain. There are plenty of examples of awareness positively impacting mental health outcomes like the Norwegian campaign to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis. 
            The impact of stigma has led to the institution of various programs worldwide to challenge the stereotypes and discrimination that generate social disability. Mental health awareness programs have had favorable impact and can produce positive change in people's views of mental illnesses. However, more robust evaluations are needed to assess the long-term impact of approaches to increasing mental health literacy worldwide.

        <div class="talking-heading">Some reasons why talking about mental health matters</div>
        
        <div class="talking-point">To combat mental health stigma</div>
        <div class="talking-description">The stigma surrounding mental health is still very much prevalent up to this day. 
        This stigma forces a lot of the brave people struggling with mental illnesses and disorders to keep their heads down and their 
        mouths shut. This can prevent us from recognizing when we need to reach out for help and possibly save somebody's life.</div>
        <div class="talking-description">Talking about mental issues allows us to discover just how common it is in everyday people. 
        It will also provide us with the opportunity to correct common misconceptions and established prejudices.</div>
        
        <div class="talking-point">To encourage action</div>
        <div class="talking-description">By creating discussions around the topic we will feel comfortable enough to recognize 
        when we need help and have the knowledge of where to seek it. Being more open about mental health struggles will foster a 
        more transparent community, where people will understand that they are not alone in their inner battles.</div>
        
        <div class="talking-point">To maintain good mental health</div>
        <div class="talking-description">Mental illness is only one aspect of mental health. All of us have mental health 
        that we should learn to cherish and nurture. Talking about mental health can encourage us to improve our inner wellbeing 
        regularly. Various tips and tricks to bolster our mental health should be given in the same casual manner and frequency as 
        it is with our physical health.</div>
